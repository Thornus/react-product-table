## Intro
A simple product table made with React.js!

Products are divided by category and each one has a name, a price, a stock pieces count and a delivery type.

Users can search for a product by name, see only the products in stock, or see only the ones with a specific delivery type.

## Instructions
Use ```npm start``` to start the server, then navigate to **localhost:3000**.
